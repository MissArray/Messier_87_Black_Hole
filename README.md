## The story behind the image
The supermassive black hole at the heart of galaxy Messier 87 (or M87 for short), or rather the stellar material that is spirals gradually into the hole, was captured by eight finely co-ordinated radio telescopes that together formed the Event Horizon Telescope. 

Galaxy M87 is 55 million light-years away from earth and the supermassive hole at its heart is an unfathomable 6.5 billion times as big as our Sun.

The name of this equally supermassive telescope - Event Horizon - describes the ultimate point that anything within a black hole's gravitational pull can reach in recognisable form, before being sucked into the black hole forever.
